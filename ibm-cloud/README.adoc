== Deploy OCP to IBMCloud

Bash script to deply OCP on IBM cloud (WIP convert it to ansible using https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/ansible-collection-ibm Looks pretty basic to me but maybe some help from IBM).

If you don't have an https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam?topic=iam-federated_id#api_key[API key file], then please create a param file (check link:params.txt[params.txt] for the format) that contain the credentials that will be used to login to IBM cloud and then script will cate the API key.
